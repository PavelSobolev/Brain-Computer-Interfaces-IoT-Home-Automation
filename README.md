# Brain-Computer Interfaces, Internet of Things and Home Automation

The project is dedicated to the development and implementation of software and hardware system for creation of interface between a human brain, computer (BCI – brain-computer interface) and devices of internet of things (created in 2018 for EDENZ Colleges (IT Academy, Diploma in Software Development, Level 7)). The BCI-based system being developed can be used by any interested person primarily for self-development and self-education in the area of human psychology and promotion of level of personal mental effectiveness (by developing ability to control personal level of attention (or activity) and level of calmness (or relaxation)). Also, such a system can be used by people with physical disabilities.  Hardware part of the project will include BCI-device and a hardware system for providing a user with live feedback showing demonstrative effect of his brain activity.  Two technical systems are chosen to implement such a feedback:
1.	home automation system which utilizes modern technologies of IoT (Internet of things) and technologies of smart home.
2.	smartphone and mobile software which are aimed to give a user possibility to train one’s ability to consciously control two mentioned above physiological processes.
Both mentioned systems are going to be controlled by data which is received from BCI based headset.

This project peruses the following goals:
1.	Planning, assembling of hardware system and implementation of software which can provide users with possibility to interact with computing devices by direct receiving and interpretation of the user’s brain activity data;
2.	Studying of modern state of BCI (brain-computer interface) technologies for usage of their capabilities for the system being created;
3.	Choosing of appropriate BCI hardware systems which are suitable for achieving of project’s objectives;
4.	Choosing of appropriate APIs, protocols, programming languages and frameworks which are optimal for achieving of project’s objectives.

### Short description of mobile app functionality

This mobile application allows the user to control component of home automation system (smart LED bulb) by sending control commands which are formed on the base of the user’s brain activity. Brain activity is measured by mobile headset which should be attached to the user scalp (data from the headset is sent to the user’s smartphone and then smartphon forms commands and sends to the home automation hub). Data of brain activity is mapped to the several characteristics of the LED-bulb which are light color and light intensity.
